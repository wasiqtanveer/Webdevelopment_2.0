(When can we do this again?)
(When can I see you again?)
(When can we do this again?)
(When can I see you again?)
(When can we do this again?)
(When can I see you again, gain, gain, gain?)

Switch on the sky and the stars glow for you
Go see the world 'cause it's all so brand new
Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine

It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's somethin' in the air you can't deny (Deny)

It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road
I gotta know, 'til then, when can we do this again?

Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can I see you again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can we do this again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, I gotta know
When can I see you again? (When can I see you again?)

Joined at the hip, yeah, your sidekick needs you
Life is a trip and a road map leads you
Look all around at the mountains you haven't climbed


It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's somethin' in the air you can't deny (Deny)


It's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
But before I go and hit the road (You know)
I gotta know, 'til then, when can we do this again?


Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can I see you again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can we do this again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, I gotta know
When can I see you again?


Don't close your eyes 'cause your future's ready to shine
It's just a matter of time before we learn how to fly
Welcome to the rhythm of the night
There's somethin' in the air you can't deny
So let me know before I wave goodbye

When can I see you again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can we do this again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can I see you again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh, when can we do this again?
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Yeah, it's been fun but now I've got to go
Life is way too short to take it slow
B-b-before I go and hit the road
Tell me when, when can I see you again?
When can I see you again? (Tell me when)
When can I see you again?
